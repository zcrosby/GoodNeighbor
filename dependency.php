For example: 

function loadclasses($classname){

then you can pass the previous function as a param into spl_autoload_register()
spl_autoload_register($loadclasses);

// this function includes all your classes for you as you need them, then you won't need to specify all your includes on every padge
// then you only need to include the dependency.php file on your pages.
//any page that you create for your user to go to, include the dependcy file.
